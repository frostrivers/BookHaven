⦁     Accessibility:
To receive full credit, you will need to include at least three rationales for accessibility. Refer to Tutorial 2.4.5 for accessibility best practices and accessibility testing.  

* These three enhancements address WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance and will significantly improve your website's accessibility for all users.
1. Keyboard Navigation & Focus Management
Rationale: Users with motor disabilities rely on keyboard navigation. Visible focus indicators ensure users know which element is currently active.

2. Color Contrast & Improved Color Accessibility
Rationale: Users with color blindness or low vision need sufficient contrast between text and background. WCAG 2.1 requires a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text.

3. Semantic HTML & ARIA Labels
Rationale: Screen reader users depend on semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels to understand page structure and interactive elements.

⦁     Responsive Web Design:
To receive full credit, you will need to include at least three RWD elements and rationales. Refer to Tutorials 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 for RWD.  

1.	Mobile-First Responsive Design - Media queries adapt layout, typography, and spacing for different screen sizes (320px to 1920px+). Ensures usability on phones, tablets, and desktops.

2.	Flexible Grid System - auto-fit with minmax() allows the product grid to reflow naturally. On mobile: 1 column, tablet: 2-3 columns, desktop: 4+ columns—without JavaScript.

3.	Touch-Friendly Targets - Touch devices receive larger tap targets (44px minimum) to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AAA accessibility standards for mobile users.
